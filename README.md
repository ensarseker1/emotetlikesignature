# Emotet-like Signature
# A sample Python Script that Demonstrates the Detection of an Emotet-like File Signature

```
import magic

# Define the path of the Office document
document_path = '/path/to/document.doc'

# Use the python-magic library to get the file type
file_type = magic.from_file(document_path)

# Check if the file type is an OLE file format
if 'Composite Document File V2' in file_type:
    print('The file is an OLE file format and may contain Emotet malware.')
else:
    print('The file is not an OLE file format and may not contain Emotet malware.')
```

# This Python code uses the python-magic library to identify the type of file and then checks if it is an OLE file format, which is commonly used by Emotet malware. Note that this is just a simple example, and additional checks using other signatures and indicators would be required for more robust detection.
